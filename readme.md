# Keystore Generator

Keystore generator to be used for testing purposes. It generates a basic Java keystore.

To run the project first package it:

```
mvn clean package
```

Afterwards a runnable jar will be in the target folder. It can be run like this:

```
java -jar target/keygen.jar keystore keystore.jks 123456 alias "CN=www.bernardomg.com, O=bernardomg, OU=None, L=London, ST=England, C=UK"
```

To show additional commands:

```
java -jar target/keygen.jar -h
```

More information, and instructions for other kinds of keystores, can be found in the documentation.

## Features

- Command Line Interface
- Generates JKS stores
- Generates symmetric JKS stores

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

### Building the docs

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.

## Usage

The application is embedded in a runnable JAR.

First package the project:

```
mvn clean package
```

Then run it like this:

```
java -jar target/keygen.jar keystore keystore.jks [password] [alias] "CN=www.bernardomg.com, O=bernardomg, OU=None, L=London, ST=England, C=UK"
```

With this a keystore.jks will appear in the folder where the command was executed.
